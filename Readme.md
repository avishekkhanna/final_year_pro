#Sound Classification using neural network

This project presents a neural network which has been trained for classifying audios using a neural network.

The file Training_network.ipynb contains the code for downloading the dataset, and then pre-processing it and training the neural network.

The file Predicting_live_audio.ipynb contains the code for taking a live audio as input and getting a prediction using the network.

We have also provided the save weights of the network in the file audio.h5 so that you can directly use the model for prediction
